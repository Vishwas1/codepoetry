# Can you suggest any name for it?

- a typescript file : poetry written in typescript. command to run: `tsc codepoetry.ts && node codepoetry.js`
- a js file : js conversion of the above typescript file: command to run: `node codepoetry.js`
- a jpg file : the actual poetry

If you have a node or tsc in your system then you can run the code using those commands and can see the output. Otherwise you need to import the `.js` file into the online js compiler and run it.
