# i?

- a typescript file : poetry written in typescript. command to run: `tsc codepoetry.ts && node codepoetry.js`
- a js file : js conversion of the above typescript file: command to run: `node codepoetry.js`
- a jpg file : the actual poetry

If you have a node or tsc in your system then you can run the code using those commands and can see the output. Otherwise you need to import the `.js` file into the online js compiler and run it. 

## cool stuffs 

Was looking for name of this poerty and my friend (Abhijit) came up with this name `i`. 

Rational:

> linguistic: because you are looking for you own meaning, "Who am I" (lower case would signify how you feel that the answer to "Who am I" is found in someone else, so you don't give enough importance to I) 

> programmatic: i is a common loop variable, which signifies how you keep looping through the same questions 

> mathematical: i is a imaginary number, which signifies the imaginary answers for which you are waiting..
